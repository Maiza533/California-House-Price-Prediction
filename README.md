## üîç About the Project:
      In this project, we will use linear regression techniques with the Python **scikit-learn** library to predict housing prices in California. The goal is to understand which characteristics of a residential property (such as number of bedrooms, location, local income, etc.) influence its market value.

The dataset used was [taken from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) and refers to the **1990 census**. We will use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to make the data ready for analysis.

Next, we will use **linear regression** to model the relationship between the characteristics of the house and its market price. To evaluate the quality of the model, we will use metrics such as **R¬≤** and **RMSE**.

Finally, a web application was created using **Streamlit**, which allows predicting the value of a property based on data provided by the user. We will analyze the results and understand the business vision of the project, which can be useful to assist real estate professionals, investors and even people looking to buy a house.
